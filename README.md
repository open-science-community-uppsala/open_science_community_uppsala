Welcome to the homepage of Open Science Uppsala,
the local Open Science community in Uppsala.

Open Science is the application of the scientific method 
in the most transparent way possible, 
such as Open Access papers, Open (and FAIR) Data,
Open Code, open peer-review, preregistration and registered reports,
resulting in research that is (more likely to be) reproducible.

This group discusses the pros and cons of Open Science 
by means of discussing papers and inviting speakers.

### Open Science

#### What is Open Science?

Open Science is a different thing for different people. A attempt of a definition that could be given: 

> Open Science is using the scientific method, 
> taking into account that scientists are human.

This means:

 * Open Access: everyone should be able to read and criticize scientistic works
 * Open Data: everyone should be able to re-use scientific data used in
   experiments, with some limitations on privacy-sensitive data
 * Open Code: everyone should be able to re-do, criticise and re-use scientific analyses
 * Open Hardware: everyone should be able to run a computational analysis
   on hardware with an open license
 * Pre-registration: scientists should be open about their initial hypotheses
   and should not pursuaded to do p-value hacking or HARKing
 * Preregistration: publishing the methods of a scientific experiment
   before doing the actual experiment
 * Registered Reports: an more stringent extension of a preregistration,
   which, after reviewing the methods of a scientific experiment,
   its results are published, regardless of the results

#### Which literature do you recommend?

 * [Search Google Scholar for 'Open Science'](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=sv&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=open+science&btnG=)
 * See [the references](#references)

### Open Science Uppsala

#### What is the goal of Open Science Uppsala?

 * to **teach** one another about Open Science (e.g. by reading papers)
 * to **discuss** Open Science
 * using **English** as the main language (i.e. most academic papers are English)
 * **regularily** (e.g. once a month)
 * for **everyone** (i.e. non-scientists are also welcome)
 * in **Uppsala** (i.e. in-person meetings)
 * for **free** (i.e. everyone can afford to participate)
 * at a **public location** (i.e. non-scientists can reach the venue)
 * in a **scholarly** way (i.e. we embrace the scientific method in our discussions)

#### What activities does Open Science Uppsala organize?

Activities by OSU are, among others:

 * Discussing Open Science papers
 * Speakers that discuss an aspect of Open Science

See 'Activities' :-)

Please contact [@richelbilderbeek](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek)
at `richel@richelbilderbeek.nl` 
if you want to organize or participate in activities.

#### How can I follow Open Science Uppsala?

 * Mastodon: [TODO by Börje]

#### Why is Open Science Uppsala at the Stadsbibliotek? Why not at the university?

Because the meetings are intended to be open to everyone
that wants to discuss the scientific method in general
and Open Science in particular.

#### What will not be accepted in discussions?

 * *Ad hominem* reasoning: instead, discuss the content of the argument instead
 * Conspiracy theories (e.g. 'All scientists are corrupt'): instead,
   discuss what the academic literature states on scientists' behavior
 * Anecdotal evidence: instead, refer to scientific studies
   and/or reviews. Of course, throwing in a personal story is OK, 
   using it as a irrefutable proof is scholarly no-go.

#### Which similar communities are there in Uppsala?

 * [Science Fika](https://www.sciencefika.se):
   an community for 20 mins science talks aimaed at a general audience
 * ReproducibiliTea Psychology: a community that focuses on 
   the department of Psychology. They do not have a website.

   a program for people interested in applying open principles 
   in their work and becoming Open Science ambassadors in their communities.

### Website

#### Why did you start this website?

As the Open Science community in Uppsala is small.
At the time this website was created, it was the first website.

#### What is the goal of this website?

To connect people that are interesting in learning more about Open Science.

### Email list

#### What is policy of the email list?

 * Sent at the first day of each month, for months that have an activity
 * Short

See [the newsletter archive](newsletter_archive.md) for previous newsletters.

### Twitter

#### What is the Twitter policy?

See [the tweets archive](tweets.md) for previous tweets.

### Information for speakers

#### What can I do?

You are boss here.

Here are some suggestions:

 * Give a talk about your own Open Science work/ideas
 * Discuss an Open Science scholarly article

#### What is the schedule?

Half an hour before the meeting, you'll have the time to prepare.
The first 15 minutes, the audience comes in.
Then you have 45 minutes left, that you can fill in yourself.
For example, you can do 30 minutes of talking and 15 minutes of questions.
