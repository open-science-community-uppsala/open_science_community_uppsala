The latter requires not only to provide ready-made results, but to explain their validity and limitations. For many science studies scholars advocating the influence of extra-scientific factors in science, this means that we (scientists, philosophers, journalists...) should make clear that there are extra-scientific values influencing all stages of scientific inquiry, including when claims are accepted or rejected. This view does not seem to correspond to the way science is actually done, and can have harmful social consequences. Rather, we should strive to make clear the uncertainties associated with current scientific knowledge. Another important distinction relates to the public engagement of scientists, who should make clear their own values in communicating their research, by distinguishing between their (descriptive) statements of facts and their (normative) statements of what to do with these facts. Both requirements enable to respect the autonomy of science results users, who can then follow their own values in their decisions making use of these results.</p>"},{"location":"events/20240517_richel_bilderbeek/","title":"2024-05-17 Rich\u00e8l Bilderbeek: 'On publishing the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data'","text":"<ul> <li>Speaker: Rich\u00e8l Bilderbeek</li> <li>Date: 2024-05-17</li> <li>Title: On publishing the analysis of exploratory research before having seen the data</li> <li>Facebook event</li> <li>Presentation website</li> </ul> <p>Writing down and publishing the analysis of a study before having seen the data is a recommended Open Science practice called pre-registration.

The next event (and last event before the summer) is this coming Friday:\n\n\"Working with pre-registrations when using register data\"\nPresenter: Rafael Ahlskog, researcher (PhD, docent) Department of Government, Uppsala University\nTime &amp; Venue: Friday 2025-05-09 16:15-17:00 @ Stadsbiblioteket\n\nPreregistered analyses have been one of the major proposed solutions to the problem of \"questionable research practices\" like p-hacking and HARKing. This solution works because ideally, we then commit to a specific set of analyses before data is even gathered. However - in many cases, researchers have to rely on data that has already been gathered by someone else. This inherently compromises the \"data blindness\" that we are supposed to have when writing up our preregistration. Is there still a way that preregistrations could be useful? How should we think about data blinding when the data is already out there?\n\n\nThe next upcoming Open Science event in Uppsala, is after the summer:\n\n- Friday 2025-09-12 16:15-17:00 (venue to be decided): Jonas S\u00f6derberg, PhD, application expert, bioinformatician, head of unit - SCoRe\n\nUppsala University, title of presentation to be decided\n\nHope to see you at our events!

The latter requires not only to provide ready-made results, but to explain their validity and limitations. For many science studies scholars advocating the influence of extra-scientific factors in science, this means that we (scientists, philosophers, journalists\u2026) should make clear that there are extra-scientific values influencing all stages of scientific inquiry, including when claims are accepted or rejected. This view does not seem to correspond to the way science is actually done, and can have harmful social consequences. Rather, we should strive to make clear the uncertainties associated with current scientific knowledge. Another important distinction relates to the public engagement of scientists, who should make clear their own values in communicating their research, by distinguishing between their (descriptive) statements of facts and their (normative) statements of what to do with these facts. Both requirements enable to respect the autonomy of science results users, who can then follow their own values in their decisions making use of these results.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n * [1] Open Science Uppsala, https://bit.ly/osc_uppsala\n * [2] By default, all events are in room Studion at Uppsala Stadsbibliotek\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"publicity/newsletter_archive/#2024-02-02","title":"2024-02-02","text":"<pre><code># Open Science Uppsala monthly newsletter\n\nDear OSU [1] email list member,\n\nThis is the monthly, short, OSU newsletter.\n\nOpen Science events in Uppsala this month [2] (talk description is at the bottom):\n\n * Friday 2024-02-09 Douglas Spangler, 'Open science, open source: Using open source software to implement machine learning risk prediction models at the Uppsala ambulance service'\n\nOpen Science events in Uppsala next month:\n\n * Friday 2024-03-15 Open Science Uppsala discusses Kungliga Biblioteket's 'Guidelines for Open Science'\n\nHope to see you at our events!

To address this challenge, my coauthors and I combine insights from a novel survey dataset documenting the submission and review activity of over 1,400 researchers with observational evidence on how peer review in economics compares to the evaluation processes in other disciplines. In this talk, I will discuss the main takeaways of our efforts, with an emphasis on exploring three key trade-offs that govern any attempts at reform: (i) the appropriate balance between relying on expert opinions and seeking input from a diverse pool of referees; (ii) the challenge of reducing turnaround time while maintaining rigor in peer review; and (iii) the difficulty of increasing the transparency of evaluations while preserving confidentiality. I will then conclude by outlining possible steps to reform some of these issues as well as the pro and cons of those potential policies.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"publicity/newsletter_archive/#2023-10-05","title":"2023-10-05","text":"<pre><code># Open Science Uppsala monthly newsletter\n\nDear OSU [1] email list member,\n\nThis is the monthly, short, OSU newsletter.\n\nOpen Science events in Uppsala this month [2]:\n\n* Friday 2023-10-20 16:15-17:00 Ismail Elouafiq, 'Experiment on yourself: open citizen science in Uppsala'\n\nOpen Science events in Uppsala next month:\n\n* Friday 2023-11-10 16:15-17:00 Adam Gill, 'Resource Allocation, Timing, and Transparency in Peer Review: A Case Study of Economics Researchers'\n\nHope to see you at our events!
