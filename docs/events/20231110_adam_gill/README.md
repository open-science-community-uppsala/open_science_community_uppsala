### Description

Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing in economics and more
broadly, but data issues have inhibited past efforts to study it. To address
this challenge, my coauthors and I combine insights from a novel survey dataset
documenting the submission and review activity of over 1,400 researchers with
observational evidence on how peer review in economics compares to the
evaluation processes in other disciplines. In this talk, I will discuss the
main takeaways of our efforts, with an emphasis on exploring three key
trade-offs that govern any attempts at reform: (i) the appropriate balance
between relying on expert opinions and seeking input from a diverse pool of
referees; (ii) the challenge of reducing turnaround time while maintaining
rigor in peer review; and (iii) the difficulty of increasing the transparency
of evaluations while preserving confidentiality. I will then conclude by
outlining possible steps to reform some of these issues as well as the pro
and cons of those potential policies.
