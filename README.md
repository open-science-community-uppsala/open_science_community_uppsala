### Open Science

#### What is Open Science?

Open Science is a different thing for different people. A attempt of a definition that could be given: 

> Open Science is using the scientific method, 
> taking into account that scientists are human.

This means:

 * Open Access: everyone should be able to read and criticize scientistic works
 * Open Data: everyone should be able to re-use scientific data used in
   experiments, with some limitations on privacy-sensitive data
 * Open Code: everyone should be able to re-do, criticise and re-use scientific analyses
 * Pre-registration: scientists should be open about their initial hypotheses
   and should not pursuaded to do p-value hacking or HARKing
 * Registered Reports: after reviewing the methods of a scientific experiment,
   its results -including a null finding- should be published

#### Which literature do you recommend?

 * [Search Google Scholar for 'Open Science'](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=sv&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=open+science&btnG=)
 * See [the references](#references)

### Open Science Uppsala
