May OSCU monthly newsletter

Dear Open Science Community Uppsala email list member,

This is the monthly, short, OSCU newsletter. The next event (and last event before the summer) is this coming Friday:

"Working with pre-registrations when using register data"
Presenter: Rafael Ahlskog, researcher (PhD, docent) Department of Government, Uppsala University
Time & Venue: Friday 2025-05-09 16:15-17:00 @ Stadsbiblioteket

Preregistered analyses have been one of the major proposed solutions to the problem of "questionable research practices" like p-hacking and HARKing. This solution works because ideally, we then commit to a specific set of analyses before data is even gathered. However - in many cases, researchers have to rely on data that has already been gathered by someone else. This inherently compromises the "data blindness" that we are supposed to have when writing up our preregistration. Is there still a way that preregistrations could be useful? How should we think about data blinding when the data is already out there?


The next upcoming Open Science event in Uppsala, is after the summer:

- Friday 2025-09-12 16:15-17:00 (venue to be decided): Jonas Söderberg, PhD, application expert, bioinformatician, head of unit - SCoRe

Uppsala University, title of presentation to be decided

Hope to see you at our events! Get in touch if you have ideas for future talks! As always, more info at the OSCU website at https://bit.ly/osc_uppsala.

## Talk description, as provided by speaker

The European Union thinks Open Science is important. One of the facets of its strategic plan is citizen science, which is using non-scientists in research. This talk will be about citizen science: why is citizen science important? What is its impact? What evidence do we have for this? And of course: where and how can a regular citizen help?

## Talk description, as provided by speaker

In the Government’s Research and Innovation Bill “Research, freedom, future – knowledge and innovation for Sweden” (prop. 2020/21:60), the government has called for a transition to a system of open science and states that data receiving public funding should be accessible, following the principle of being “as open as possible, as closed as necessary,” by 2026. This session will provide a background with updates on current progress in this space while introducing interactive polling elements to help with the understanding of topics and the prioritisation of open science approaches.

## Talk description

'Unlocking Access' explores the essential components for making Open Science truly inclusive and impactful. In an era where knowledge dissemination is increasingly digitalised, mastery of language, digital literacy, and critical thinking skills stand as gatekeepers to accessing scientific knowledge. From the perspective of an educator and language specialist, this talk examines the importance of language proficiency and education on effectively utilizing open scientific resources. By bridging accessibility and expertise, is it possible to foster a fairer, informed society?

## Talk description

Writing down and publishing the analysis of a study before having seen the data is a recommended Open Science practice called pre-registration. This practice will, among others, prevent the authors of the scientific paper to make up story that fit the data well. However, while this practice is suitable for hypothesis-driven research, it's suitability is doubted for exploratory studies. This talk presents the results from a literature search and other findings to answer the question 'How suitable is a pre-registration in exploratory studies?'.

## Talk description

Apart from its intra-scientific goals (such as ensuring the reproducibility of scientific results), open science aims at making scientific information available to non-specialists (e.g. decision-makers and the wider public). The latter requires not only to provide ready-made results, but to explain their validity and limitations. For many science studies scholars advocating the influence of extra-scientific factors in science, this means that we (scientists, philosophers, journalists…) should make clear that there are extra-scientific values influencing all stages of scientific inquiry, including when claims are accepted or rejected. This view does not seem to correspond to the way science is actually done, and can have harmful social consequences. Rather, we should strive to make clear the uncertainties associated with current scientific knowledge. Another important distinction relates to the public engagement of scientists, who should make clear their own values in communicating their research, by distinguishing between their (descriptive) statements of facts and their (normative) statements of what to do with these facts. Both requirements enable to respect the autonomy of science results users, who can then follow their own values in their decisions making use of these results.

## Talk description

Just as the open science movement is changing how we do research, 
open source software is changing 
how we put the fruits of our research into practice. 
In this talk, Douglas will discuss how machine learning research 
is transformed into clinical decision support systems 
using open-source tools based on R and Python at the Uppsala ambulance service, 
and the potential that this approach has to transform how IT-systems 
are procured and maintained in the public sector at large.

* Adam Gill
* Resource Allocation, Timing, and Transparency in Peer Review: A Case Study of Economics Researchers'

Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing in economics and more broadly, but data issues have inhibited past efforts to study it. To address this challenge, my coauthors and I combine insights from a novel survey dataset documenting the submission and review activity of over 1,400 researchers with observational evidence on how peer review in economics compares to the evaluation processes in other disciplines. In this talk, I will discuss the main takeaways of our efforts, with an emphasis on exploring three key trade-offs that govern any attempts at reform: (i) the appropriate balance between relying on expert opinions and seeking input from a diverse pool of referees; (ii) the challenge of reducing turnaround time while maintaining rigor in peer review; and (iii) the difficulty of increasing the transparency of evaluations while preserving confidentiality. I will then conclude by outlining possible steps to reform some of these issues as well as the pro and cons of those potential policies.
