# Ask for publicity text

- Title: OSCU publicity text

Hi `[speaker_name]`,

I see in the Open Science Community Uppsala schedule [1],
that on `[date]` 16:15-17:00 you'll be giving the talk
`[talk_title]`.

I could use a short text to describe the talk. This text will be used in publicity and has the goal the help readers decide why they should go.

Could you help me with that?

The publicity goes out at around `[deadline_date]`, hopefully with your added text :-)

Thanks and cheers, Richel
