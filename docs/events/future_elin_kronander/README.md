## Talk description

Is Open Data worth the effort?
This talk explores the PathOS project (Pathways to Open Science),
a systematic EU initiative to develop methods for quantifying
the real-world impact of Open Science.
We will explore the PathOS framework,
focusing on how they trace Open Science Impact Pathways
to prove the causal links between open data practices and tangible outcomes.
